# Today I Learned by Alejandro Cabrera

Ruby and Rails official documentation reading personal journal

## Week 1

### Thurs 23, July 2020 *RSPEC*
I started reading Rspec, because I dont feel i had enough knowledge about this gem, and how make my tests properly. So i read about before and after hooks, and, with help, could apply it on my last kata tests, looking like this:

And then, I believe i can apply this on the next katas and other excercises i'll do.

### Friday 24, July 2020 *Hash*
I choose this method, because I started to get problemns on my koans, and i don't know much about this type of method, and how use it well by myself.
I read how create a hash, how create and use their keys, and how work with the values I save on it.

### Monday 27, July 2020 *More Hash*
I keep working with this documentation, mainly i keep getting problems with my koans, and add it to my katas and other excercises i would do.
This time i read about how delete keys, how use it with .each loop, and fetch.

### Tuesday 28, July 2020 *how send works*
Today I read about how the method ' send ' works on ruby, and what i could do with it.
I learned it gets the value inside their brackets, and use as a parameter to the object it sends.
I used this on the kata Args Parser last week, but i didn't understand how work on that days.
